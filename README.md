#### _Rebuild old AngularJS project in React_

_The original prompt was to create a CRUD web application for an imaginary tap room. This new project is to recreate that old application using React instead of using Angular._

## Notes

 * Even during the first look at the angular application I can see that the cards that have the kegs on them will need to be broken down into a bunch of smaller components rather than a single component like it is in angular.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone Repository to Desktop_
* _Navigate to directory in Terminal_
* _Run npm install_
* _Run npm start_
* _Project will open browser window and localhost:8080 _
